This project aims to create a real-time collaborative digital whiteboard application using the Python Django framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. The application will allow multiple users to draw, write, and interact with a shared canvas in real-time.
The "Online Collaboration Using Digital Whiteboard" project introduces an interactive, browser-based platform that enables real-time collaboration among users, functioning as a virtual workspace for remote teams. We built it using a robust tech stack—Python, Django, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebSockets , and WebRTC—this system supports dynamic teamwork by allowing users to simultaneously interact with a shared digital whiteboard.
